Python AI & NLP Showcase: From Data Engineering to PredictionA collection of production-ready Python models demonstrating core concepts in Data Engineering, Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository includes examples using classic Kaggle datasets for house price prediction and movie review sentiment analysis.üöÄ Project OverviewThis repository serves as a practical, hands-on guide for data engineers and ML enthusiasts. It bridges the gap between raw data and deployed models, showcasing the end-to-end lifecycle of a data science project. The models are self-contained, well-commented, and designed to be easily understood and adapted.Key Features:Classic ML Regression: A linear regression model to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset.Modern NLP Classification: A sentiment analysis model using a powerful pre-trained transformer from Hugging Face to classify IMDb movie reviews.Real-World Data: Utilizes popular and well-understood datasets from Kaggle to ensure practical relevance.Ready-to-Run Code: Each model is a standalone script that can be executed directly after installing the required dependencies.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackLanguage: Python 3.8+Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPyMachine Learning: Scikit-learnNLP / Deep Learning: Hugging Face transformers, PyTorch (or TensorFlow)IDE: VS Code, Jupyter NotebookPackage Management: pipüì¶ Installation & SetupTo get started with these models, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: A requirements.txt file is included in this repository for convenience.)üìä DataThe models in this project use two well-known datasets from Kaggle. You must download the data and place it in the root directory of this project before running the scripts.Ames Housing Dataset: Used for the house price prediction model.Download Link: House Prices - Advanced Regression TechniquesFile needed: train.csvIMDb Movie Reviews Dataset: Used for the sentiment analysis model.Download Link: IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie ReviewsFile needed: IMDB Dataset.csv‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the ModelsEnsure the required data files are in the project's root directory before running the scripts.1. House Price Prediction ModelThis script will load the Ames housing data, train a linear regression model, and predict the price of a sample house.python predict_house_price_kaggle.py
Expected Output:--- Loading and Preparing Data ---
Loaded 1460 rows of clean data.
Features we will use: ['GrLivArea', 'BedroomAbvGr', 'FullBath']
--------------------

--- Training Model ---
Model training complete.
--------------------

--- Evaluating Model ---
Model Performance (Root Mean Squared Error): $48,343.84
--------------------

--- Making a New Prediction ---
Predicted price for the new house: $279,131.85
2. Sentiment Analysis ModelThis script will load the IMDb dataset, sample a few reviews, and classify their sentiment as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE using a Hugging Face transformer model.Note: The first time you run this script, it will download the pre-trained model from Hugging Face (a few hundred MB).python analyze_sentiment_kaggle.py
Expected Output:--- Loading Sentiment Analysis Model ---
Model loaded successfully.
